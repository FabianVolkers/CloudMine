      ### Multiline options
    
      # Multiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
      # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation
    
      # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
      #multiline.pattern: ^\[
    
      # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
      #multiline.negate: false
    
      # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
      # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
      # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
      #multiline.match: after
